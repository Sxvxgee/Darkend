### <p align=center> A Gui based Dank Memer farmer  with all the services you need to make Dank memer devs cry.

# Farewell, Darkend.
Darkend has been discontinued. The code might not be the best but I made this to push my limits and learn new things, keep in mind this is my first GUI application ever, I think I did a good job. I will not be accepting PRs or responding to issues since Darkend will no longer be maintained by me. If you want to know how to build it, you're a skid and you should probably stay away from the code, I won't provide any information on how to run it.
The code was in the process of a new private beta updated, so it's unstable. I hope Dank Memer fixes their economy and makes actual good updates and fixes to their system and make a better anti-cheat.

Star the repo and follow me if you use this code, I'd appreciate the support. It's been a long run.

Special thanks to my private beta testers and all the friends I've made whilst developing Darkend. Especially to splewedge, formally known as didlly.

# Disclaimers
1. Here at Darkend we do **not** believe in manually editing the configuration files of the accounts.
    - If you face any issue/bug after manually editing the files, you will **not** be assisted.
<br></br>
2. While Darkend is safe, it is still a use-on-your-own-risk application.
    - No account was disabled while using Darkend, but **nothing** can be 100% safe.
<br></br>
3. Shifts are not added **yet**.
    - I advice you autofarm for less than 5 hours before taking a break for a few hours so you don't get banned.
